This application was built for development purposes.

Assuming that you have all the vue, express and mongodb packages and tools, and after cloning the application, execute fetchProductData.js and fetchUsersData.js, these will create 2 json files. 

Create a database with 2 tables, vue-db and users.
Insert the generated json file from fetchProductData.js in vue-db.
Insert the generated json file from fetchUsersData.js in users.
